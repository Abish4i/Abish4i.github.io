About Me

   An enthusiast for continuous learning, I thrive on exploring new ideas
   and perspectives. While finance and technology are my main areas of
   focus, you'll often find me reading diverse recommendations, watching
   films, or enjoying a stgame. I see myself as someone who enjoys
   untangling problems creatively—whether it’s making sense of market
   trends or breaking down complex challenges. What truly drives me is not
   just figuring out how things work, but understanding why they work that
   way.

What I'm Working On Currently

   Building finance and technology enabled solutions that actually solve
   problems. Right now, I'm working on a few projects close to my heart:
   an interactive analytics dashboard that turns complex data into clear
   irrespective of data formats, actionable insights; a straightforward
   price tracker in real-time market movements; and a C2C platform that's
   rethinks P2P transactions through a credit-based implementation. Every
   project gets the same care and attention as my first—because I believe
   in creating practical, user-focused tools that use technology to tackle
   real-world challenges.
