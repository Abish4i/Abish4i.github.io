                <p class="muted">Mostly curiosity and trying to learn new things. Other than finance and technology, you'll often find me reading random recommendations,watching movies, or enjoying a chess game. I believemyself to be a creative problem-solver—whether I'm analyzing market trends or breaking down problems. My approach is mostly seeking to understand not just the "how" but the "why".</p>

                    <h3 style="margin:0 0 8px 0;">What I'm Working On Currently</h3>
                    <p class="muted">I'm trying to work on synergies of finance and technology that enables changes that fixes problems. Developing an interactive analytics dashboard that transforms complex data into actionable insights, building a simple price tracker to monitor market movements in real-time, and building a customer-to-customer (C2C) platform that reimagines peer-to-peer transactions using credits. Each project has equal commitment to my very first and I'm try creating practical, user-centric solutions that leverage technology to solve real-world problems.</p>

                <p class="muted"><b>Background:</b> Multidisciplinary learner with expertise spanning Finance, Information Technology, and Mathematics—a combination that enables me to bridge analytical thinking.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin:0 0 8px 0;">My Preferences</h3>

While I'm flexible with remote or onsite arrangements, I'm looking for positions where I can make meaningful contributions alongside talented teams who share a passion for innovation and help me grow.</p>
